# Django-Blog
This is my technical write up talks about Python-Django. Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source. I found it very interesting and exactly what I was looking for. This is purely based out of my learning and a few references from YouTube and GitHub, which I feel would be helpful for anyone to begin with.
